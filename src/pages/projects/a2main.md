Web design proposal for a shiatsu massage practitioner.

Shiatsu massage therapy relies on the use the fingers, thumbs and palm to apply pressure to various areas of the bodyâ€™s surface to help heal common ailments and conditions, and correct imbalances in the body. Pressure applied to points on the body promotes energy flow and corrects disharmonies throughout the patient's body. In addition to being a deeply relaxing experience, Shiatsu helps relieve stress, treat pain and illness, and contributes to a patient's overall health and wellbeing.
